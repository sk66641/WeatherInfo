sk66641: why weatherList.length is 0 even if it is running after getWeather function which fills setweatherlist

```jsx
const showWeather = () => {
    if (form.lat === "" || form.lon === "") {
        alert('All fields are required!');
        return;
    }
    if (weatherList.length > 0) {
        const checkValues = weatherList.some(
            (item) => item.coord.lat === parseFloat(form.lat) && item.coord.lon === parseFloat(form.lon)
        );
        if (checkValues) {
            alert("Values already exist");
            return;
        }
    }
    getWeather(form.lat, form.lon);
    console.log(weatherList.length);
    setForm({ lat: "", lon: "" });
};
```

GitHub.copilot-chat.github.copilot.editor: It seems like the weatherList state is not being updated as expected before the console.log statement is executed. This is a common issue in React due to the asynchronous nature of state updates. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **State Initialization**: Ensure that weatherList is initialized properly using `useState`.
2. **State Update**: Ensure that `setWeatherList` is called correctly within the `getWeather` function.
3. **Asynchronous Nature**: React state updates are asynchronous, meaning the console.log might be executed before the state is actually updated.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```jsx


import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Weather = () => {
  const [weatherList, setWeatherList] = useState([]);

  const getWeather = async () => {
    // Simulate an API call
    const data = await fetchWeatherData();
    setWeatherList(data);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getWeather();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(weatherList.length); // This will log the length after weatherList is updated
  }, [weatherList]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render weatherList here */}
    </div>
  );
};

const fetchWeatherData = async () => {
  // Simulate fetching data
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(['Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Cloudy']);
    }, 1000);
  });
};

export default Weather;
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Initialization**: `const [weatherList, setWeatherList] = useState([]);` initializes the state.
2. **State Update**: `setWeatherList(data);` updates the state with the fetched data.
3. **Asynchronous Nature**: The second `useEffect` hook logs the length of `weatherList` after it has been updated. By using the second `useEffect` hook with `weatherList` as a dependency, you ensure that the `console.log` statement runs only after `weatherList` has been updated. This way, you can see the correct length of `weatherList`.
