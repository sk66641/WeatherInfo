### Warning: Internal React error: Expected static flag was missing. Please notify the React team.

```javascript
export const convertUnit = (celsius) => {
    // const Unit = useSelector((state) => state.tempUnit)
    const { changeTempUnit } = useContext(ContextTempUnit)
    return ${changeTempUnit ? convertToF(celsius.toFixed(0)).toFixed(0) + " °F" : celsius.toFixed(0) + " °C"};
};
```

The error arises because you are attempting to use the `useSelector` hook outside of a React component's function body. React hooks, including `useSelector`, cannot be used in plain functions—they can only be called within React functional components or custom hooks.

### Why This Happens
The following line violates React’s rules of hooks:
```javascript
const Unit = useSelector((state) => state.tempUnit);
```

Since this code is in a utility function (`convertUnit`), React cannot guarantee that the `useSelector` hook is being called in a proper React rendering context.

### But why usecontext is not giving error even if it's a hook?

Great question! The reason why `useContext` works in your utility function without triggering an error, while `useSelector` does not, lies in **how React evaluates hooks** and their usage contexts.

---

### **Key Difference: `useContext` vs. `useSelector`**

#### **1. `useContext`:**
- `useContext` only relies on the React context that is available higher in the component tree. It does not depend on the Redux provider or any external mechanism.
- Even if you call `useContext` inappropriately (e.g., outside of a component), React might not immediately throw an error because it only needs access to the React context during the function's execution.

However, using `useContext` in a utility function is still risky. If that function is invoked outside of a component tree where the context provider is present, it will fail with an error like:  
`Uncaught Error: Could not find context value`.

#### **2. `useSelector`:**
- `useSelector` is tied to the **React-Redux ecosystem**, and it actively integrates with the Redux store. It depends on React-Redux's `Provider` to subscribe to state updates.
- React-Redux enforces strict rules to ensure that `useSelector` is only called within the body of a functional component that is inside the `Provider`. This restriction ensures that `useSelector` can manage subscriptions and performance optimizations correctly.

---

### **Why React Allows `useContext` But Not `useSelector` in Utility Functions**
React itself does not enforce hook usage rules as strictly for `useContext` because:
1. **Context Is Stateless**: `useContext` doesn't create subscriptions or trigger re-renders based on external state—it just reads the current context value.
2. **No Middleware**: Unlike Redux, React contexts don’t depend on middlewares or external mechanisms.
3. **React Philosophy**: React is designed to tolerate some flexibility with `useContext`.

In contrast:
- `useSelector` subscribes to Redux state updates.
- Its implementation relies on hooks like `useEffect` and `useRef`, which must follow React's rules of hooks.

---

### **Why This Is Still a Bad Practice**
While `useContext` doesn’t always throw an error when used improperly, **it is still considered bad practice** to use any hook (including `useContext`) in a utility function.

#### Problems You Might Face:
1. **Breaking Abstraction**:
   - The utility function (`convertUnit`) now has a hidden dependency on React's context, making it harder to test and reuse.

2. **Potential Errors in Non-React Context**:
   - If you call the utility function outside a React component (or outside the `ContextTempUnit.Provider`), it will throw an error.

3. **Unpredictable Behavior**:
   - If the context provider isn't properly set up or changes its structure, the function might fail unexpectedly.

---

### **Best Practices**
To avoid issues:
1. **Pass Context Value as a Parameter:**
   Refactor `convertUnit` to accept the `changeTempUnit` value as an argument:
   ```javascript
   export const convertUnit = (celsius, changeTempUnit) => {
       return `${changeTempUnit ? convertToF(celsius).toFixed(0) + " °F" : celsius.toFixed(0) + " °C"}`;
   };
   ```
   Use it like this:
   ```javascript
   const { changeTempUnit } = useContext(ContextTempUnit);
   const convertedTemp = convertUnit(25, changeTempUnit);
   ```

2. **Stick to React Component Scope for Hooks:**
   Only call `useContext` and `useSelector` inside React components or custom hooks, not standalone utility functions.

3. **Use Custom Hooks for Context Access**:
   If you need reusable logic:
   ```javascript
   export const useTemperatureUnit = () => {
       const { changeTempUnit } = useContext(ContextTempUnit);
       return changeTempUnit;
   };
   ```

   Then in your component:
   ```javascript
   const changeTempUnit = useTemperatureUnit();
   const convertedTemp = convertUnit(25, changeTempUnit);
   ```

---

### Conclusion
The lack of errors with `useContext` is due to React’s design tolerating its flexible usage, but this doesn’t mean it's good practice. Refactor your code to avoid directly calling hooks like `useContext` or `useSelector` inside utility functions for cleaner, more testable code.
